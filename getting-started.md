# Getting started with Okyanus

It's really easy to install Okyanus. All you have to do is the following:

- Download [okyanus-loader](https://github.com/okyanus-mc/loader/releases)
- Run the server with `java -jar okyanus-x.y.z.jar`
- It will do some preparation, and your server will be up and running.

While installing the server itself is that easy, most mods will require the
**Okyanus Runtime**. Installing that is even easier, though.

- Download [Okyanus Runtime](https://github.com/okyanus-mc/runtime/releases)
- Place it in your `mods` folder.

And you should be fully set up! Run your server and execute the `/mods` command
to check.

Please make sure to regularly update both your server, and runtime.
